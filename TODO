BUGS

- using "-d:TraceCalls=Foo->" seems to enable tracing on all calls to
  Foo's base classes, not just calls for Foo subclasses.

IMPROVEMENTS
- Allow STRINGIFY to be depth oriented
- (low priority) use something other than Data::Dumper so's we can print refs
  as \%{Foo::Bar} (at which point the STRINGIFY feature needs to be renamed
  something like "OBJRECURSEDEPTH" and "REFRECURSEDEPTH"
